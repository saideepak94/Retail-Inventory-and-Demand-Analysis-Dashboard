# Retail-Inventory-and-Demand-Analysis-Dashboard
This project analyzes retail inventory, sales performance, and supplier reliability using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The goal is to help a retail business understand which products are selling fast, which items are at risk of stockout, how demand changes over time, and which suppliers perform well or poorly.
